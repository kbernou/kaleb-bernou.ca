<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Batter: 1. Mix softened butter with both sugars, then add egg, baking powder, and vanilla extract; 2. Mix well, then add the flour. Mix it all with electrical mixer, until fairly smooth. 3. Fold in chocolate chips</p>
<p>Cooking: 1. Line slow cooker with parchment paper. 2. Pour batter into slow cooker. 3. Cook on high for ~2.5 hours 4. Should be about done, poke it with a toothpick. If it makes you happy, eat it!</p>
<p>Does end up with a gooey centre for me, but thatâ€™s what I like. In larger, more normal slow cookers then it might be more cooked through.</p>
