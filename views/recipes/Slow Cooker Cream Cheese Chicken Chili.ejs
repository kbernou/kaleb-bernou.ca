<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 15oz can of black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>1 15oz can of corn, undrained</li>
<li>1 10oz can of Rotel tomatoes</li>
<li>1 package of ranch dressing mix</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
<li>1 tbsp chili powder</li>
<li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
<li>1 8oz block of cream cheese</li>
<li>2 chicken breasts</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drain and rinse the black beans.</li>
<li>Place chicken at the bottom of the crock pot, then pour out the whole can of (undrained) corn, Rotel tomatoes, and black beans on top of the chicken.</li>
<li>Top with seasoning mix. Stir together.</li>
<li>Place cream cheese block on top. Cover with lid and cook on low 6-8 hours.</li>
<li>After cooking time is over, remove chicken from crock pot and shred and add back to chili. Stir together and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frozen corn instead of canned corn may result in crunchier corn</li>
<li>Philadelphia brand cream cheese may melt better and not by lumpy</li>
<li>Thighs over breasts. They are way cheaper, almost impossible to overcook, and have so much more flavor! You donâ€™t even have to remove the thighs once they are done cooking. If you stir everything in the crock pot, the chicken will literally just fall apart.</li>
<li>Add about two cups of chicken broth before cooking. Adds flavor, and the chili is still plenty thick with the broth added</li>
<li>Add diced cilantro at the end (if you like cilantro)</li>
</ul>
