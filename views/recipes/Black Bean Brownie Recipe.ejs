<h1 id="black-bean-brownie">Black Bean Brownie</h1>
<p>A healthier brownie, that you wouldn’t know is made of beans. Makes 9-12 brownies. ## Ingredients * 1 1/2 cups black beans (1 15-oz can, drained and rinsed very well) (250g after draining) * 2 tbsp cocoa powder (10g) * 1/2 cup quick oats (40g) (See nutrition link below for substitutions) * 1/4 tsp salt * 1/3 cup pure maple syrup, honey, or agave (75g) * pinch uncut stevia OR 2 tbsp sugar (or omit and increase maple syrup to 1/2 cup) * 1/4 cup coconut or vegetable oil (40g) (See nutrition link for substitution notes) * 2 tsp pure vanilla extract * 1/2 tsp baking powder * 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup chocolate chips (115-140g) (Not optional. Omit at your own risk.) * optional: more chips, for presentation</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
<li>Combine all ingredients except chips in a good food processor, and blend until completely smooth. Really blend well. (A blender can work if you absolutely must, but the texture—and even the taste—will be much better in a food processor. I use this food processor.)</li>
<li>Stir in the chips, then pour into a greased 8×8 pan.
<ul>
<li>Optional: sprinkle extra chocolate chips over the top.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cook the black bean brownies 15-18 minutes</li>
<li>Let cool at least 10 minutes before trying to cut. If they still look a bit undercooked, you can place them in the fridge overnight and they will magically firm up!</li>
