title: Recipes
---

A collection of recipes I've picked up over the years. They come from friends,
family, online, cook books... all over. Mostly they're here so that I've got a 
central, searchable collection in a consistent format (rather than a scattering
of web pages, pictures, and text files in varying formats that might not exist
in a year).

I try to give credit to the source, but I didn't capture the source for all of 
them before I formalized this collection. Many apologies for that.
