It's the website.

I had serverside injection pointed out to me later. That almost certainly could have gotten me to where I wanted, but I'm committed to this now. Plus there's something to be said about having the site entirely self contained.

# Development
* Clone
* Nodemon is nice to have: `npm install -g nodemon`
* `npm install`
* Run with `nodemon index.js` (or simply `node index.js`)
